# RETRO_SNAKE_GAME
This repository contains the source code for the Retro Snake game, built with C++ and Raylib. The game implements essential features like a snake that moves in four directions, food consumption to grow the snake, and collision detection with the walls and its own body. The game uses sound effects to enhance the experience.


## Features
- **Snake Movement**: Control the snake with arrow keys.
- **Random Food Generation**: Food appears at random positions, and the snake grows longer when consumed.
- **Collision Detection**: The game detects collisions with walls and the snake's own body.
- **Sound Effects**: Play sounds on food consumption and wall collisions.
